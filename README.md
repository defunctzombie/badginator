Some people like repo badges so this is a badge to count your repo badges.

## Install

Just add the badge to your readme.md file like so!

```markdown
[![BADGINATOR](https://badginator.herokuapp.com/<username>/<repo>.svg)](https://github.com/defunctzombie/badginator)
```

## Colors

Your badge color will reflect how many badges you have. The more badges you have the better!

| Badges | Color |
| --- | --- |
| ≤ 2 | ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/badges-2-red.svg) |
| ≤ 4 | ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/badges-4-orange.svg) |
| ≤ 6 | ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/badges-6-green.svg) |
| > 6 | ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/badges-15-brightgreen.svg) |

## Toubleshooting

Why isn't my badge count correct?

* Github README images are cached and the badge image has not updated. Give it some time.
* or, There is a bug in our badge detection logic and you should [file an issue](https://github.com/defunctzombie/badginator/issues/new)# badge-test
